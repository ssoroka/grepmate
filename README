== To Do

- check ~/.grepmate for current rails repo to use instead of always using latest
- change output file to write to /tmp or something
- add include parameter to selectively include file extensions
- Allow global and cwd .gmconfig files to determine things like exclusions and inclusions.
- If we're not in a RAILS_ROOT, assume -r ./*
